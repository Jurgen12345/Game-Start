This project is a "Steam" like library, that has some games that I have uploaded in a Firebase NoSQL database from Google, which are shown in the store and can be added in the library by purchasing them. Note: * The Firebase database that i have created
will be expired in a bit, that is the reason that the application might not be able to log in the user and fetch the game library.*
